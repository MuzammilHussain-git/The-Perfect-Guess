# Perfect Guess Game

This Python script is a fun and interactive "Perfect Guess" game where you try to guess the number chosen by the computer. The goal is to guess the number in as few attempts as possible.

## How to Play

1. **Set the range:**
   - Enter the maximum number for the range in which the computer will pick a random number.

2. **Make your guesses:**
   - Enter your guesses to find the number.
   - The game will guide you:
     - "Higher Number Please!" if your guess is too low.
     - "Lower Number Please!" if your guess is too high.

3. **Win or Lose:**
   - If you guess the number correctly in less than half the range (e.g., for a range of 1â€“100, fewer than 50 attempts), you win!
   - Otherwise, you lose.

4. **Exit or Replay:**
   - Enter `0` at any time to exit the game.
   - After each round, choose `y` to play again or `n` to exit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required.
